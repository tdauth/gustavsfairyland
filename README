Compilation instructions:
On Windows 7 the program has been compiled using the MinGW distributed with Qt.
The shell path in CMake has to stay clear.
Unfortunately there is only a 32 Bit compiler.
Generator: Code Blocks - MinGW Makefiles

Qt Creator does not autodetect Qt on Fedora:
ln -s /usr/bin/qmake-qt5 /usr/bin/qmake
ln -s /usr/lib/qt5/ /usr/lib/qt

For Android:
Download SDK and NDK.
Use the corresponding CMake module.
Add the path to "android" to your PATH ./Android/Sdk/tools/
