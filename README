"fairytale" is a simple puzzle game on time where the player has to choose the right clip to construct a custom fairytale.

Compilation instructions:
Create a binary directory and run:
cmake <path to fairytale folder>

Now compile everything in the binary directory:
make -j4

For Linux:
Just use cpack in the build directory:
cpack .

It creates an RPM and a DEB package.

On Windows 7 the program has been compiled using the MinGW distributed with Qt.
The shell path in CMake has to stay clear.
Unfortunately there is only a 32 Bit compiler.
Generator: Code Blocks - MinGW Makefiles
CPack creates an NSIS based Windows installer.

For Android:
Download SDK and NDK.
Use the corresponding CMake module.
Add the path to "android" to your PATH ./Android/Sdk/tools/

Use the following CMake modules for Android deployment:
https://github.com/taka-no-me/android-cmake
https://github.com/LaurentGomila/qt-android-cmake/

There is a Bash script "buildandroid.sh" which does everything as long a virtual Android device is installed properly
and the paths are correct.

The program zipalign might not be found for signing the app.
It is in /home/tamino/Android/Sdk/build-tools/24.0.1/zipalign but expected in
/home/tamino/Android/Sdk/build-tools/zipalign
Just do:
ln -s /home/tamino/Android/Sdk/build-tools/24.0.1/zipalign /home/tamino/Android/Sdk/build-tools/zipalign

Use the following command to get debugging output:
/home/tamino/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb logcat
