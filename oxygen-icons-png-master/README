Oxygen Icons Set in PNG format only updated from http://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/oxygen-icons/download.
This repository can be used by people that want to provide oxygen icons theme to non opened system like Windows and Mac OS X easily.
We added a create-qrc.sh script that generate a qrc file for the current theme if really needed.
In general, we would like to prohib you doing that, you will make your binary grow a lot, and the compilation of the qrc cpp file will take a lot of resource / time.

PLEASE NOTE: This is not my icons, so the original oxygen license (LGPL) still apply here.
